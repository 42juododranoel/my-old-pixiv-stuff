My old abandonded project. I keep it here, because it has some good code for face detecting and Pixiv integration, may be useful someday.

## History

21 April 2016 was the birthday of Pixiv-kun, a bot for Russian social network https://vk.com/. Pixiv-kun was publishing 48 arts from https://pixiv.net/ per day. Later it was improved to support https://www.pixivision.net/en/ and https://yande.re, then renamed to Artwork-kun. I shut it down after one year of work, because I was moving away from VK. After one more year I have re-created Artwork-kun. 22 September 2018 is the birthday of Kirisame, an engine for managing bots in Mastodon social network.
